Taylor's tool life equation
 VT^n = C
The force necessary to shear metal can be calculated by:
 F= SLT
  where: F = blanking or punching force(lb, or N)
         S= shear strength of material( psi or Pa)
         L = sheared length (in, or m)
         T = material thickness (in, or m)
for round holes
  F = SÉŒDT
 where D = diameter(in , m)
